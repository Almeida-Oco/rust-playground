# rust-playground
Just a repository to host my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) projects

Most of the projects might not be working. This is exactly as advertised, a playground

Branches will hold the different projects. 
I realize ideally all projects should have their own repo, but for the sake of messing around with git/github and branches I decided to do it this way.
